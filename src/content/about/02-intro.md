# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Welcome! Iâ€™d like to use this little section to tell you about myself ðŸ¤“

My journey started with hosting a Minecraft server in high school, sparking my passion for web development. I freelanced through college before becoming a solution engineer. In 2021, I pursued a Master's in Japan, focusing on physically-augmented interaction. Now, I'm a lead technical engineer, handling various technical aspects beyond coding. I'm committed to continuous learning and growth in the global tech community.
