long: "Started as a Vue.js front-end engineer and advanced to a leadership role. Skilled in end-to-end product management, architecture, and development, with a passion for creating exceptional technology experiences. Curious about computers since 2011, I began accepting freelance solution development jobs in 2016. Through work at Idea Vivat and freelance projects, I gained expertise in front-end development, UX design, solution architect, and client-facing communication. My Master's studies at Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan furthered my knowledge in research processes and human-computer interaction research methodologies."
