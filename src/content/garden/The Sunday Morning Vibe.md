A random note for a random morning. Have you ever gotten that... Sunday morning feeling? A feeling that makes you think this day is for you and only you. You look outside and you see this day as a day for your housework, relaxation, and your relationship. I think it's a weird vibe that I haven't felt for so long. Last I had this vibe was on a lazy Sunday while I was in Japan for my Master's degree. Time flies fast, not only during that time abroad, but here too.

I felt that today.
