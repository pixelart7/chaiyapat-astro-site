I like one-bag travel. It's easy, it's compact, and it limits my spending on "souvenir" (a.k.a presents for myself to remind me of this trip.) And I have to say that this bag really does it for me.

# How I Discover Evergoods

I first discovered EVERGOODS through [Pack Hacker](https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/evergoods/civic-half-zip-26l-chz26/), the brand as a whole received a lot of praise from various media. I do like EVERGOODS mission and vision where they focused on the utility of their products, basically similar to how I like studying user experience. I do share this vision with them where I want to build products that _just works_. I just enjoy seeing people build awesome products, and I strive to bring joy to people with my products too.

And luckily enough, that happened in 2022 when I was studying in Japan, and there was a Japanese reseller. Purchasing EVERGOODS bags was as easy as pie. And, coincidentally, they have a clearance sale of this CHZ26 bagâ€¦ in Signal Blue color. If you never guessed from this website accent color, yes, I do like light blue.

So almost immediately after seeing that, I ordered the bag, envision myself using it on 3-to-4-days trip, and starting planning and dreaming me using this very bag.
