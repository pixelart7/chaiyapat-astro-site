A good game to play if you are into cyberpunk setting

Positive Points:
- Charming City: The city is appealing in terms of architecture design, I adore the cyberpunk setting that this game approaches.
- Good Story... in Some Parts: Story are well-written for some characters, but might not be well narrated for some. There were many memorable moments in the game that I'm fond of them to these days.

Negative Points:
- Minor Bugs: I think they fixed a lot of bugs after they released the game, but there are still some immersion-breaking bugs left behind.

Recommend If:
- You watched CP2077: Edgerunners
- You can handle some bugs
- You enjoy sci-fi cyberpunk setting
