I believed that note-taking doesn't have a one-size-fits-all methodology. I've been through so many methods of taking notes. It started from taking a physical course note in college, moving to digital notes on iPad, and now, Obsidian as my primary note-taking tool.

# A Brief History of My Note-taking

I made the section heading sound so grand.

After the mandatory course note-taking in high school, I found love in taking course note in college. I used my version of Cornell Notes, the small column is on the right instead, the rest are the same. This structure carried over to my iPad note-taking era. But this Cornell method dropped when I started using digital note-taking.

Well… I didn't said "started using Obsidian" because it wasn't a sudden change right away. I've gone through Google Keep, Notion, and even Craft. But when I discovered Obsidian back in 2021/2022, I felt like I struck gold.

# My Love For Obsidian

I discovered Obsidian as a note-taking app, not an application for second brain or digital garden… yet. As a developer, at the slightest, I enjoy the idea of my notes in Markdown. And then Obsidian said it lives in you local file system, I think fainted.

_Wakes up_, well… Obsidian stores all notes in local file (think of it as photo files or document files) in local filesystem. It feels like I own the data unlike previously mentioned application which my notes live on cloud (granted they have export feature.)
