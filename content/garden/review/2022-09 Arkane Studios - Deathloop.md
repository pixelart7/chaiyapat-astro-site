Another stealthy, fun game from Arkane

- + Fluid Control: Similar to Arkane's previous games, Dishonored, Deathloop offers a fluid control, a fun experience navigating through a level.
- + Lovable Enemy: I'm quite fond of the character development in this game. You learn about them bits by bits, and I apprciate them moreby the end of the game.
- - Quite Short: The story is quite short. However, it may be limited because of the nature of the game (timeloop.)
- - UX: Transitioning between time of day is quite clunky buy understandable. I went in without reading a lot of reviews, and was a bit disappointed that you can't travel between distract/time by foot. But as I said, it would be quite challenging to give a free-roam like that.

Recommend If:
- You like stealth games, especially Dishonored
