A well-crafted stealthy linear story

- + Well-designed UI and UX: I liked that it offers UI setting for immersion outright. I set it and I never felt regret. I think they designed it well that they don't need to explicitly explain how to do things.
- + Story: Follow the story of siblings, I explored and navigated through harsh world that these two had to face. It is a linear story that separate into chapters, I felt like I was reading a great book.

Recommend If:
- You are okay with linear story games (The Last of Us, Tomb Raider, ...)
- You can handle a little bit of fright
