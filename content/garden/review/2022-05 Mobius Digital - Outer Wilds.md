A must-play game that you need to go in blind

- + Stunning Physics Engine: My jaw dropped when I learned that this game hand-coded their physics engine. It makes everything in the game feels super realistic, even though it is just a sandbox-sized universe.
- + Be an Adventurer: I like that it throw you a whole universe to explore. The game came with a system that help you navigate through story points that I found it really useful.

Recommend If:
- You played exploration-based games before (Subnautica, No Man's Sky)
- You are filled with curiosity
- You like space-sim game
