Ever since I started web development, I've been through so many blogging platforms. Most of them I deployed to learn the ins and outs of deploying something. I think I started with WordPress. After a while, I moved to Ghost on the cloud, which I spent using lunch money. Then Medium arrived, I secured a domain `blog.pix7.me` while it was free to do so. But I've never written anything routinely.

There's always something about writing that deter me from doing so. I always find myself wanting to add more ideas and improve what I write. Basically, I never think of my blog post as being perfect, ready for printing press kinda thing. It feels more like a note to me, a note that I wanted to publish for people to read. All the blogs that I used felt like that.

But I think I know how to start writing and "publishing" again.

â€¦

I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for normal note-taking (ideas, journaling.) I migrated from Bear Notes, Notion, and Day One, and put everything in just this app. For those who aren't familiar with Obsidian, it is a note-taking app that uses a native file system (you know, folder, files, Windows Explorer, macOS Finder, all of that) to store your notes as a Markdown. I really liked the idea of all my notes in files, that way I can move them around without restricting myself to a proprietary format that others note-taking apps may have (imagine trying to export your notes from Notion or Evernote.)

After using as a note-taking app for a while, I learned the concept of a [[second brain]], the idea of putting knowledge into digital notes with links between each note to help fortify the relationship between knowledge. And that's when I got my will to write back.

And here we are, a new place, all customized and personalized to how I liked it. I will add the explanation of the garden concept and how I build this site below. (That's how comfortable I am to "publish" a non-finish note :P)
