To help me bring notes out as easily as possible, I adopt and adapt the concept of evergreen note-writing. For me, I always feel like I have to carefully read through everything ten or a thousand times before I feel confident enough to release my notes. This system allows me to tell the readers that some notes are literally just my notes, there might be grammatical errors (as I'm not a native English speaker,) and ideas might not be concrete, but those are something that I want to publish.

There are three stages:
1. Note – The simplest form of my note, contains small things, small ideas, that might grow later.
2. Sapling – Notes that I continue writing and it contains more information, if there are sources, I'll put them in here. Technically, notes are considered sapling when I write an abstract/excerpt or make a cover image (I don't want to manually change the stage of my note.)
3. Evergreen – Notes in this stage are like an essay/a publication/a blog post that is 100% ready for reading (think of it as it heading to a printing press.) Ideas that the title has is concrete with sources to back them. Technically, notes with abstract/excerpt and cover images are considered evergreen.
