# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Welcome! Iâ€™d like to use this little section to tell you about myself ðŸ¤“

My professional journey began in high school. I hosted a Minecraft server, built a website for it, and discovered my passion for web development. That experience ignited my love for front-end development, and I cherish seeing how people interact with the systems I create.

During college, I worked extensively as a freelancer, eventually landing a role where I proudly call myself a solution engineer. Iâ€™m confident in my ability to provide solutions or at least know who to ask for help.

Driven by curiosity, I wanted to learn how to conduct research properly. In 2021, I received a scholarship to study abroad for a Master's degree in Japan, where I joined a lab focusing on physically-augmented interaction. I'm fascinated by the question, "How can we take a break from this busy world and absorb information more slowly?"

After graduation, I returned to work as a lead technical engineer, responsible for various technical decisions beyond coding, including solution analysis, infrastructure, and internal workflows. Being part of a global community of technical engineers, I am committed to continuous learning and growth.
