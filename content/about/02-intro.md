# ðŸ‘‹ Hello!

Welcome! I want to use this little section to tell you about myself ðŸ¤“

I started my professional career back in high school. I hosted a Minecraft server, I built a website for that server, and in turn, I learned web development. After that, I fell in love with front-end development. I cherish the process of developing and seeing how people interact with the front-end part of the system.

In college, I spent quite some time working as a freelance. I landed in a company where I proudly call myself a solution engineer. I'm confident that I can provide a solution, or, at the very least, I know who to ask.

Curiously, I want to learn more about how to conduct research properly. In 2021, I received a scholarship to study aboard for a Master's degree in Japan.

Currently, I'm in a lab that studies physically-augmented interaction. I am interested to answer "how can we take a break from this busy world, taking information slowly."
